## üöÄ Installation (Tools / Environment)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Ruby (if not installed)

Ceedling is a Ruby gem. Check your Ruby installation:

```bash
ruby -v
gem -v
```

If Ruby is missing:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Ceedling (includes Unity + CMock + CException)

```bash
sudo gem install ceedling
sudo gem update ceedling
```

‚úÖ Verify installation:

```bash
ceedling version
```

Expected output:

```
üå± Welcome to Ceedling!

 Ceedling => 1.x.x
 ----------------------
 /var/lib/gems/.../ceedling-1.x.x/

 Build Frameworks
 ----------------------
 CMock => x.x.x
 Unity => x.x.x
 CException => x.x.x
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install gcov for test coverage report

```bash
sudo apt install gcov
gcov --version
```

---

## üöÄ Create and Run Project

### Create a new Ceedling project

```bash
ceedling new my_project
cd my_project
```

You can write your own test cases in `my_project`, or you can clone this simple example project to try it out:

```
https://github.com/nguyenloi120998/simple-ceedling-test
```

### Run all tests

```bash
ceedling test:all
```

### Run a specific test file

```bash
ceedling test:test_simple_module.c
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example Test Output

```
Building test: test_simple_module.c
Linking test_simple_module.out...

Running test_simple_module.out...

```

The output above shows the test results in the terminal.\
Next, we will generate a detailed coverage report using gcov.

---

## üìä Generate Coverage Report

In `project.yml`, enable the following plugins and settings:

- `gcov`
- `module_generator`
- `report_tests_pretty_stdout`
- `html_detailed`
- `:html_artifact_filename: TestCoverageReport.html`
- `:html_title: Test Coverage Report`

Run the following command:

```bash
ceedling gcov:all
```

Check the coverage report at:

```
my_project/build/artifacts/gcov/gcovr/TestCoverageReport*.html
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
src/                # Your source code (.c/.h)
test/               # Test files
vendor/             # Ceedling, Unity, CMock frameworks
build/              # Build artifacts
project.yml         # Ceedling config
```

---

## üîó Notes

- Ceedling automatically includes Unity and CMock ‚Äî no need to install them separately.
- To generate code coverage report:
  ```bash
  ceedling gcov:all
  ```
  Check reports in `build/artifacts/gcov/`.
